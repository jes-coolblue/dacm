# Senior Engineer developer case

You are the senior engineer part of a team of developers and together you own a platform that enables content from the creatives to be made available to consumers via other digital platforms.

## Problem

An application needs to be in place for content distribution. So the digital platforms can consume it.

## Complexities

You have identified the following complexities:

* The app has a backend where they aggregate data from many different domains
* There are some missing links between OrderListMetadata and BriefingMetadata
* The ContentDistribtuion file must come from cached or an equivalent solution
* Solution must be designed to run in containers

## Your task

The application must expose content and metadata through an interface that can be easily consumed by digital platform developers as the briefing and order process.

The integration technology for the API consumers can be assumed by you. If you need them to be event driven or restful that is your choice.

We do not expect a complete solution to the presented problem. We recommend to stub parts of the solution in order to get into depth on other parts. It is up to you to select the focus areas that best covers your skillset and your area of interest.

## Metadata Clarification

* OrderListMetadata: Order of briefs to be created for a given campaign
* BriefingMetadata: Brief of assets to be produced
* AssetMetadata: Detailed asset information
* ContentDistributionMetadata: Contains URLs for content access

## Constraints for the case

* Solution must be written in C# and .NET
* Solution must be designed to run on Amazon Web Services or Azure
* Presentation must be in place and take no more than 20 minutes - including time for questions
* LEGO brand shouldn't be mentioned in any part of your code or presentation
* You can download any content files and store them locally or use any free API to request them. However, please keep in mind that all content files should be royalty-free

### Expected outcome:
* Walkthrough of your code
* Software diagram for the solution. In LEGO, we use the C4 model (https://c4model.com/). You can also use a tool like https://cloudcraft.co/app to visualize a cloud setup in AWS. If you prefer another tool, that is also acceptable
* A GitHub project with all files relevant to the case
* Deck of slides presenting the solution, challenges and how you would collaborate with fellow team members -- mentor fellow engineers and work with the product team + other cross-functional roles  
* Oral presentation of the solution, including an explanation about design decisions and possible limitations

This case study should be achievable within 8 to 12 hours. Good luck!

### What are we testing:
* Technical, Communication & Presentation skills
* Domain knowledge of system design and architectural concepts
* Being able to understand and interpret a problem with limited input
* Creating a solution with limited input and within a limited frame
* Learning mindset - how you gather the information needed to move on

### Submission Guidelines:
* All files and code must be uploaded to your public GitHub repository (or similar)
* Do not make any references to the “LEGO” in any publicly accessible project files
* A URL to the repository should be sent to plinio.ciccio@lego.com two days prior to the interview
